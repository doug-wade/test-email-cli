# test-email-cli

test-email-cli is a cli application for generating and managing test email
addresses.

## Installation

To install, make sure you have node installed

    sudo apt-get install nodejs

Then install test-email-cli globally

    npm install -g test-email-cli

Before using it the first time, make sure to initialize the configuration

## Use

To generate a new test email address, run `test-email generate`

    test-email generate
    > doug+2016-11-17-1@dougwade.io

You may also want to pipe the results to your clipboard directly
with [xclip](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xclip) (on Linux) or
[pbcopy](http://ss64.com/osx/pbcopy.html)

    test-email generate | xclip
    # doug+2016-11-17-2@dougwade.io is now on the clipboard

You can search old generated test emails with `test-email find`

    test-email find
    > doug+2016-11-17-1@dougwade.io

You can limit searches by `date` and by ticket number, if provided when
generated

    test-email generate
    > doug+2016-11-17-1@dougwade.io
    test-email generate --ticket=1
    > doug+2016-11-17-2@dougwade.io

    > doug+2016-11-17-2@dougwade.io
